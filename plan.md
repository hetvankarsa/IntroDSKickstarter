* Figure out what my task is

  * Project plan: 
    STAGE 1: Exploring data.
    Time period is between 3rd and 5th. we will meet on the 5th; each one of us has to :
    A. analyze the features from the dataset in jupyter notebook, and try to find some correlations and statistical patterns 
    B. try to find at least two derived features that would help in predicting whether a project receives funding or not
    C. based on our findings, we can individually think of a model that suits this dataset (except for neural networks, cuz that needs to be done anyway)

    This way, we can meet in saturday (5th) and debate what we found, thus quickly choosing an appropriate model.
    After that, we can divide the work on modelling. 

    STAGE 2: start on modelling the two algorithms. Time period for this should be between the 5th and the 10th.

    STAGE 3: Results and presentation. Time period is between 10th and 14th

  * Ioana: The Project Plan: Please update the git repository before Thursday morning with all additional features which you have discovered. Wednesday, is a project meeting day please so please all of you state at what time you are available. Currently, there is a division in group members as two models need to be implemented. Roxana will probably do a linear regression model while me and Victor will do a neural network. Please consider to which group you wish to contribute; the groups must be balanced. Thursday is a second meeting day. Please state the time periods when you are available again.

  * Ioana: Please add to the ReadMe file of the whole project the features you have selected and calculated. The ones which you feel have the moat importance

* Help Roxana

  * Me and Roxana are doing linear regression to find the correlation between the values from the dataset from kickstarter.

* Learn about linear regression

  * https://www.dummies.com/education/math/statistics/using-linear-regression-to-predict-an-outcome/

* Basically, in order for us to do the linear regression, we first need to choose the features and then perhaps put these in sub-categories and check for correlation. Only if there are (semi-)strong correlations, can we do multiple linear regression on it. If we have the graph of multiple linear regression, we should be able to predict other values and calculate the correctness.
